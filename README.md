This repository demonstrates a common Haskell error involving type mismatches when working with Maybe types and list functions. The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, attempting to apply `map (+1)` to a `Maybe Int`, which causes a type error. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.hs`, correctly handles the Maybe type using pattern matching or the `maybe` function.  This example highlights the importance of careful type handling in Haskell.
