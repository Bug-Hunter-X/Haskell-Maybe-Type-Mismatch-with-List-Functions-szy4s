The solution uses pattern matching to handle the `Maybe` type appropriately. If `maybeValue` is `Just x`, then `map (+1)` is applied to the list `x`. If it is `Nothing`, then the function returns `Nothing`.  Alternatively, the `maybe` function provides a concise way to handle the `Nothing` case. 

```haskell
maybeValue :: Maybe [Int]
maybeValue = Just [1, 2, 3]

-- Solution using pattern matching
safeMap :: Maybe [Int] -> Maybe [Int]
safeMap (Just xs) = Just (map (+1) xs)
safeMap Nothing = Nothing

-- Solution using maybe
safeMap' :: Maybe [Int] -> Maybe [Int]
safeMap' = maybe Nothing (
xs -> Just (map (+1) xs))

main :: IO ()
main = do
  print (safeMap maybeValue)
  print (safeMap' maybeValue)
```
